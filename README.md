## My process
- After setting up the enviroment. I started with the background, and then tried my best to get the elements the same as the design from top to bottom. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This was my first challange, and it was usefull to get me more comfortable with css

I learned how to set a svg file as a pattern for the background

```css
.body {
  background: #E0E8FF url(/images/pattern-background-desktop.svg) repeat-x right top;
}
``` 
and how a simple shadow-box can drastically improve the visuals of a webpage


```css
.button {
  box-shadow: 0 0.4rem 1rem hsla(241, 85%, 68%, 0.87) ;
}
```



### Continued development

I still need to learn more about how to layout better the elements, and learn how to use the css grid, sice right now I am using only css display:flex to layout everything. 

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp) - This helped me to get some css reference.
